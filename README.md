# Data Science Notes

This is a repository to store my personal notes about my learnings in Data Science.

## Metrics

- Accuracy: $accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$
- Precision - $precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$
  - High precision = lower FP rate, i.e. not many TP are incorrectly classified as FN
- Recall: $recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$
  - High recall = lower FN rate, i.e. most TP are classified correctly
- F1 Score: $f1 = 2\times \frac{precision\times recall}{precision + recall}$

## Algorithms

### KNeighborsClassifier
- Used for supervised classification
- measured by Accuracy

# Tips and Tricks
To generate a requirements.txt file from the command line: pip freeze > requirements.txt
