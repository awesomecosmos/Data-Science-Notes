# Data Science Notes

This is a repository to store my personal notes about my learnings in Data Science.

## Data Science Dictionary

### Accuracy
$accuracy = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$

### Precision
$precision = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$
High precision = lower FP rate, i.e. not many TP are incorrectly classified as FN

### Recall
$recall = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$
High recall = lower FN rate, i.e. most TP are classified correctly

### F1 Score
$f1 = 2\times \frac{precision\times recall}{precision + recall}$
